      <p>Even if your website is located outside of the countries-members of the European Union, it is important to know the policies that might apply to your website in case you have users from the EU.</p>

      <h4>EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h4> <br>
      <p>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) is a comprehensive data protection law that took effect on May 25, 2018 updating existing European Union laws to strengthen the protection of user’s personal data (any information that can be related to an identifiable individual) in light of rapid technological developments, the increasingly global nature of business and more complex international flows of personal data. It replaces the current patchwork of national data protection laws with a single set of rules, directly enforceable in each EU member state. 
</p>
      <br>
      <p>The EU General Data Protection Regulation is applied towards all websites outside of the European Union that process data of people that are located inside the EU.</p>
      <p>For example, if you have a website in the United States and you have someone who visited your website from a country that is a part of the European Union, then you are obligated to comply with GDPR policies. If that is the case, then the website needs to meet the GDPR requirements and conditions for processing data.

      <p>
There is a list of principles that website administrators should follow in case their servers are processing EU users’ data. It is outlined in Article 5.1-2 of GDPR:
        </p>
        <br>
       <code> <ol>
<li>Lawfulness, fairness and transparency — Processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent to the data subject.</li>
<li>Purpose limitation — You must process data for the legitimate purposes specified explicitly to the data subject when you collected it.</li>
<li>Data minimization — You should collect and process only as much data as absolutely necessary for the purposes specified.</li>
<li>Accuracy — You must keep personal data accurate and up to date.</li>
<li>Storage limitation — You may only store personally identifying data for as long as necessary for the specified purpose.</li>
<li>Integrity and confidentiality — Processing must be done in such a way as to ensure appropriate security, integrity, and confidentiality (e.g. by using encryption).</li>
<li>Accountability — The data controller is responsible for being able to demonstrate GDPR compliance with all of these principles.</li>
         </ol> </code>
     <br>

    <br> <h4>Accountability</h4> <br>
     <p>According to GDPR, data controllers have to be able to prove and demonstrate they are compliant with GDPR policies. And this isn’t something you can do after the fact: If you think you are compliant with the GDPR but can’t show how, then you’re not GDPR compliant. Among the ways you can do this:
</p>
     <br>
<ol>
  <li>Designate data protection responsibilities to your team.</li>
  <li>Maintain detailed documentation of the data you’re collecting, how it’s used, where it’s stored, which employee is responsible for it, etc.
</li>
  <li>Train your staff and implement technical and organizational security measures.</li>
  <li>Have Data Processing Agreement contracts in place with third parties you contract to process data for you.</li>
  <li>Appoint a Data Protection Officer (though not all organizations need one)
</li>
</ol>
     <br>
     <br> <h4>Data security</h4> <br>
     <p>It is important to handle data securely by implementing “appropriate technical and organizational measures.”
 Technical measures can mean anything from requiring  employees to use two-factor authentication on accounts where personal data are stored to contracting with cloud services that use end-to-end encryption.
 Organizational measures can include adding a data privacy policy to the employee handbook, or limiting access to personal data to only those employees in your organization who need it.

      <br>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
        <br>
      <code>
        <ul>
<li>The passing of GDPR has directly impacted data privacy and security standards while also indirectly encouraging organizations to develop and improve their cybersecurity measures, limiting the risks of any potential data breach.
</li>
<li>Users and customers value their privacy and their confidence can be hurt if a breach of data will occur and their personal information will become available on a dark web. Customer is more willing to share their private information on GDPR compliant websites, as they believe their data is being stored and used in line with European law. 
</li></ul>
      </code>
      <br>
<h4>Cons</h4> <br>
      <code>
<ul><li>Unfortunately, the regulation itself contains 88 pages and that doesn’t include accompanying directives. The information presented on this page is optimized to highlight the most important aspects of the law. 
</li>
<li>If the organization is affected by the GDPR and required to be compliant with its policy, it is highly recommended that someone in the organization reads it and that every employee is able to consult an attorney to ensure they stay compliant with GDPR requirements. This can lead to some extra spending, and it is definitely not going to be budget-friendly. 
  </li> </ul> </code> <br>
          <h4>Website Examples</h4>

<p><code>The online retailer <a href="https://www.asos.com/privacy-policy/
" rel="external" target="_blank"> ASOS</a> has great pages on its website, including their updated privacy policy, featuring educational video content, clear headlines that are written using their brand tone, and a policy which is easy to digest for most web users.
      </code>  </p>  <br>
<code> <p><a href="https://www.loreal.com/loreal-group-privacy-policy" rel="external" target="_blank"> L’Oréal</a> describes in detail the list of data that they would potentially collect, which is obviously a subject to the user’s consent. In addition to that, the information is provided in question-answer format which makes it easier for users to learn about their privacy policies.
  </p> </code> <br>
<code> <p>British grocery store chain’s <a href="https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/" rel="external" target="_blank"> Sainsbury’s</a> sign-up form experience is very straightforward and clear; in places where the form asks for extra personal details, such as their phone number and club card number, explanations are provided as to why the company needs them.

     <ul>
There are 3 main rules we should follow while making our website GDPR compliant:
       <br>
<li>Lawful means all processing should be based on a legitimate purpose.</li> 
<li>Fair means do not process data for any purpose other than the legitimate purposes. </li>
<li>Transparent means that we need to inform about the processing activities on user’s personal data.</li>
       </ul>
